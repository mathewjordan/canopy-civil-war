Johnson married Blackstone&#x27;s daughter Julia in 1847 and together they had a daughter named Adela in 1848. Johnson enlisted as a surgeon with the 18th Ohio Volunteer Infantry at the start of the Civil War and served until 1864. Five of his seven children with Julia died before reaching adulthood. He had at least two more children after returning from war: Alberta and Louis. During this time, he also served as a member of the Ohio House of Representatives. In 1870, he moved to Indianapolis with Julia, Adela, Alberta, and Louis. Julia died in 1872. Johnson died 17 years later in 1889.
